# Predictive Irrigation: Intelligent Irrigation Machine Project - Iwas Iwas

## Tools:

Keras
Scikit-Learn
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

## Structure:

**- Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing**
  - Load, inspect and preprocess the dataset 
**- A Beginning: Building first simple model**
  - Build and visualize first keras model 
  - Fit and evaluate first keras model
  - Visualize performance by plotting a validation accuracy learning curve
**- Optimization - Can we increase the performance?**
  - Do we need more data?
    - Visualize Accuracy with different train-test-splits
  - Which activation function to use for the Hidden Layer?
    - plot two learning curves that show the development of the validation accuracy and validation loss for each activation
      over all Epochs 
  - Does Batch Normalization improve the performance?
    - Introducing Batch Normalization
    - Visually comparing the model performance with and without batch normalization
**- Conclusion**
    - Summary
    - Next steps
