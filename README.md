# Predictive Irrigation: Intelligent Irrigation Machine Project - Iwas Iwas

## Motivation:

Today, climate change is a big problem for a farm. The crops in some regions are threatened, if not destroyed due to heat and drought. If it does not rain enough, watering the fields is often a necessity. The motivation behind this project is to use deep learning to build an intelligent irrigation machine to irrigate the fields of a farm in a more precise and targeted manner by predicting the probability of a parcel having enough water or not. By doing this, we can predictively irrigate the parcels/fields and tacke the heat and drought problem. 

## Tools:

Keras,
Scikit-Learn,
Pandas,
Numpy,
Matplotlib,
Seaborn


## Structure:

**Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing**

  - Load, inspect and preprocess the dataset 
  
**A Beginning: Building first simple model**

  - Build and visualize first keras model 
  - Fit and evaluate first keras model
  - Visualize performance by plotting a validation accuracy learning curve
  
**Optimization: Can we increase the performance?**

  - Do we need more data?
    - Visualize Accuracy with different train-test-splits
  - Which activation function to use for the Hidden Layer?
    - plot two learning curves that show the development of the validation accuracy and validation loss for each activation
      over all Epochs 
  - Does Batch Normalization improve the performance?
    - Introducing Batch Normalization
    - Visually comparing the model performance with and without batch normalization

**Final results: Interpreting Sigmoid Multi-Label Classification Output**

- Engineer the model output and print the results in tables
    
**Conclusion**

  - Summary
  - Next steps
